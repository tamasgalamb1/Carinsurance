# Carinsurance
# I have created an MVC website which reflect a carinsurance website. To filter the age of the drivers, I used If statements. A databse was created using SQL, tables were addedd and data was added and connected to the C#project. Created controllers and connected them. Used Entity Framework. Installed NuGet.
